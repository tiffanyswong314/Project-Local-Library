Project description: Local library

Your neighborhood has decided to put together a local library where people can lend and borrow books. One of the most important features needed to organize this is a dashboard that will show which books are available, which are currently out, and other general statistics about the program.

Other people are taking care of the logistics and design, but they need you to build the algorithms.

Local library dashboard.

Learning objectives

This project is designed to test your ability to work with large datasets and build algorithms based on those datasets. You will not need to make any edits to HTML or CSS for this project. Before taking on this project, you should be comfortable with the learning objectives listed below:

Using Visual Studio Code as a text editor

Differentiating between the three most common JavaScript error types

Solving bugs by using error messages

Differentiating between let, const, and var, and using each appropriately

Creating an array from a string based on particular criteria and joining arrays into strings

Writing strings that embed expressions using template literals

Accessing all the values and keys of an object

Using find(), filter(), map(), some(), and every() to solve different problems

Using reduce() to solve different problems

Using sort() to sort arrays in various ways

Project steps to complete

To complete this project, you must do the following:

Write code that passes all the tests in the Qualified assessment in this lesson.

Write code that passes all of the requirements outlined below, and submit your GitHub repo link to the Thinkful team in the next lesson.

Requirements to pass

For your project to pass, all of the following statements must be true. These criteria are reflected in the rubric in the following lesson.

All tests are passing in Qualified.

The project doesn't include any single-letter variables.

The project makes at least one use of an arrow function.

The project makes at least one use of each of the following native array methods: find(), filter(), map(), and reduce().

The project employs at least one helper function, which helps support the tested functions.

The project uses at least two of the following JavaScript features: the ternary operator, the spread operator, object shorthand, array or object destructuring, and for/in loops.
